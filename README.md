# FIFA-Analysis

This is a group project I collaborated on that focused on data analysis and data visualization. It is an analysis that investigates goals from FIFA matches spanning over 100 years from 1916 through 2023. The aim of this project is to understand how the sport has evolved over the years, identify standout teams and players, and understand what patterns and influences affect goal scoring.

The 'plots' folder contains all visualizations that I contributed to this group project. I also contributed to the overall data cleaning and processing and report writing. See the report for the full results.
